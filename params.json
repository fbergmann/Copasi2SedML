From there things could not be simpler as you can see in the code to the command line converter:\r\n\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nvar converter = new Copasi2SedMLConverter(inputFile);<br/>\r\nconverter.SaveTo(outputFile);\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n## Command Line converter\r\nThe command line converter expects two arguments, the COPASI input file, and the SED-ML output filename. If the output filename ends in `.sedx` (the format for the SED-ML archive) the archive will be produced, i.e: the model will be included together with the description. \r\n\r\n<code>\r\n\tCopasiSedMLExport.exe inputFile outputFile \r\n</code>\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Frank T.
